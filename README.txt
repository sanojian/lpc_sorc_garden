Building and running
--------------------

This game runs best in Google Chrome.  Will also run in Mozilla Firefox.  There is no
reason it should not run in IE but has not been tested.  To ensure that the game runs properly, 
either run from the demo page or install into a web server and run from there.  Running from
a local directory will not always work depending upon your environment.
